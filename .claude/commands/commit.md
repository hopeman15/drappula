# Commit Guidelines

## Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits style: `type: description`
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `chore:` maintenance tasks
  - `refactor:` code refactoring
  - `test:` adding or updating tests
  - `ci:` CI/CD changes
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Use lowercase for the description (e.g., `feat: add user auth` not `feat: Add user auth`)

## Important
- **NEVER add co-author information or AI attribution**
- Commits should be authored solely by the user
- Do NOT include any "Generated with Claude" messages
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines
- Write commit messages as if the user wrote them
