# Pull Request Guidelines

## Pull Request Format
When creating pull requests:
- Use conventional commits style for titles: `type: description`
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `chore:` maintenance tasks
  - `refactor:` code refactoring
  - `test:` adding or updating tests
  - `ci:` CI/CD changes
- Keep the summary concise with bullet points
- Do NOT include a "Test plan" section

## Important
- **NEVER add co-author information or AI attribution**
- PRs should be authored solely by the user
- Do NOT include any "Generated with Claude" messages
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines
- Do NOT include AI/Cursor attribution
- Write PR descriptions as if the user wrote them
